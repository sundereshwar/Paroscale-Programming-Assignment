Assignment Code

1. Program a multi-threaded producer and consumer with locks on concurrent access to a memory location using C/C++/Golang. 
Explanation: 
Have a global list / array where two or more producers append randomly generated numbers concurrently. A consumer thread must dequeue from the global list and print it! 


2. Write a script on any language to get the list of running PID by parsing “ps -ef” command 
Explanation: 
ps -ef is a Linux command, which shows all the running processes in the system. The problem is to write a script that parse the output of ps -ef and provides the PIDs. Consider the output of ps -rf is given a string input to you. 


3. Implement a basic memory allocation system using C/Golang programming. - Using different data structures, implement the libraries which provide the functionality to allocate and deallocate clunk of memory. 
For example: 
my_function_alloc(size_of_allocation) 
my_function_dealloc(size_of_allocation) 
- You can preallocate a large memory buffer in your library and assign blocks of memory as the request comes from the user. 
- Write an application which uses these library functions for allocation and deallocation of the memory.
